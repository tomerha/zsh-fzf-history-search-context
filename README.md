# zsh fzf history search with context

A zsh plugin that replaces `ctrl-r` with an fzf-driven, searchable list of history, and also gives
you the context around the selected command (what executed before and after).

It also lets you "jump" into that context with `tab` in order to select another command from there
to recover.

## Requirements
* [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
